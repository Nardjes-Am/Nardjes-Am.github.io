I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Ecole Polytechnique Paris (CNRS), working under the supervision of [Oana Goga](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Oana.GOGA/). I am a member of [CEDAR](https://team.inria.fr/cedar/), a joint team between Inria, CNRS, and LIX (Computer Science lab of Ã‰cole Polytechnique) focusing on rich data analytics at cloud scale.

My research investigates user exposure to and consumption of information in the digital age, focusing on how AI-driven algorithms shape these experiences. I analyze user behavior, examining patterns of information seeking, and consumption across various platforms. I also study the risks associated with AI-driven information targeting, such as the spread of misinformation, and potential for manipulation. By exploring the impact of AI on information ecosystems, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by these technologies in shaping public discourse and individual autonomy.

Before my thesis, I graduated as a Computer Science Engineer from the Higher National School of Computer Science [ESI](https://www.esi.dz/en/home/). I did my final year internship at the Grenoble Informatics Laboratory in Grenoble (France) [LIG](https://www.liglab.fr/fr).
