I am a Ph.D. student at Ecole Polytechnique Paris (CNRS), working under the supervision of [Oana Goga](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Oana.GOGA/). I am a member of [CEDAR](https://team.inria.fr/cedar/), a joint team between Inria, CNRS, and LIX (Computer Science lab of École Polytechnique) focusing on rich data analytics at cloud scale.

My research examines how users encounter and engage with information in the digital age, with a particular focus on the role of AI-driven algorithms in shaping these experiences. I analyze user behavior to identify patterns of information seeking and consumption across diverse platforms. Additionally, I investigate the risks associated with algorithmic information targeting, including the spread of misinformation and the potential for manipulation. By exploring the broader impact of AI on contemporary information ecosystems, this research seeks to advance understanding of both the challenges and the opportunities these technologies present for public discourse and individual autonomy.

Before my thesis, I graduated as a Computer Science Engineer from the Higher National School of Computer Science [ESI](https://www.esi.dz/en/home/). I did my final year internship at the Grenoble Informatics Laboratory in Grenoble (France) [LIG](https://www.liglab.fr/fr).
